              <h2>Sarthak Sidhant Portfolio</h2>
              <p>Originally, The Website was a template from Philip Gilbert and Forked under an Open Source License, There were Paid Options Available,
                But I took the free remake without the Javascript. After that, The Site has undergone many changes, and does not resemble the Original 
                Template by Any Means, The Color Pallete has changed, Many Functionalities Have Been Removed and Many Others Have Been Added as per my need, 
                Therefore, Not Crediting The Original Template Wouldn't be needed, but I am a generous person. You can <a href="https://github.com/front-end-by-rimantas/40-grupe-portfolio-personal">Visit</a>
                The Template Repository. The Website is hosted on a Public Github Repository, and The Website is Currently Registered Under A Modified Version Of GNU Affero General Public License that Prevents Commercial Use
                 The Website will be completely static, I have no future plans except changing the content a few times and that's pretty much it. The Portfolio website will be static in the foreseeable future. Suggestions are Allowed.
                 The Website is Hosted on <a href="https://sarthaksidhant.me/">https://sarthaksidhant.me/</a> and <a href="https://sarthaksidhant.me/">https://sarthak-sidhant.github.io/</a>
                Some Previous Versions of The Websites are not available anymore, and the history of the website dates back to the ancient times, and I request to not be cancelled due to them.
             However, A Previous Version, Which Was Also A Template Named 'Hielo' (probably or something else i really cant remember) has been saved in the deep roots of the repository which you can <a href="https://sarthaksidhant.me/dev/prev-back/">Visit Here.</a>
            That's Pretty Much It.</p>
